git clone https://github.com/shegara/intranet-centar-municipality.git

# USAGE
The Intranet Centar Municipality application is designed to provide a centralized hub for managing and accessing various employee and service data within the municipality. The application is split into two main interfaces:

*User Interface*

Navigate through the multi-page site using a responsive design that adapts to different devices.
Search for employee information using the search bar, which retrieves accurate results from the backend.
View service details, documents, and other relevant information.

*Admin Dashboard (CMS)*

Accessible to authorized personnel, the admin dashboard provides a clean and simple UI for managing employee data.
Perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on employee records, services, and documents.
The CMS ensures all changes are immediately reflected across the system.
